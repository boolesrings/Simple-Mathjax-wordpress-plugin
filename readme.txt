Yet another plugin to add mathjax support to your wordpress blog.  This is the only plugin that uses $ signs for equations by default.

== Description ==

This wordpress plugin is yet another simple plugin to load the mathjax script
at the bottom of all of your pages.  It uses a very all-inclusive mathjax
configuration by default, with $'s and $$'s the default delimeters for
in-line and displayed equations.

A preference pane is added to the "Settings" group where you can modify the
CDN used (the mathjax server) and the configuration (if you know about mathjax
configuration specifications).  You can also specify a LaTeX "preamble" of
newcommnds which will be loaded in a hidden element near the top of each
page.
