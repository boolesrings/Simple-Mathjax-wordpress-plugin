Yet another plugin to add MathJax support to your wordpress blog.
Just wrap your equations inside $ signs and MathJax will render
them visually.

== Description ==

This wordpress plugin is yet another simple plugin to load the
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) scripts at the bottom of all of your
pages.  It uses a very all-inclusive mathjax configuration by default,
with $'s and $$'s the default delimeters for in-line and displayed
equations.

A preference pane is added to the "Settings" group where you can
modify the MathJax server location (CDN) and the MathJax configuration
settings.  (See [this
page](http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/configuration.html#using-in-line-configuration-options)
for details on the options available.)  You can also specify a LaTeX
"preamble" of newcommands which will be loaded in a hidden element
near the top of each page.
